# L2gaslessmint
This smart contract is suitable for use with a Zk-rollup because it allows for gasless NFT minting, reducing the burden on the Ethereum network and making it easier for users to create and transfer NFTs.
The smart contract implements a deposit and withdraw function for an NFT, allowing users to deposit Ether and then mint new NFTs without having to pay gas fees. The mint function allows users to create a new NFT and assign it a unique token identifier and token URI, which can be used to store information about the NFT such as its name, description, and image.
